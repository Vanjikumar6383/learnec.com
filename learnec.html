        <h4>E_LEARNING?</h4>
    <center>
        <p>E-learning -- also called electronic learning or web-based training -- is anywhere, anytime instruction delivered over the internet or a corporate intranet to students and other learners via a browser. Contrary to traditional learning methods, e-learning lets students, employees in training and casual learners participate in an organized learning experience regardless of their physical location.

            In its formative years, e-learning tools primarily enabled the delivery of learning material directly from a teacher to a learner. Now, the e-learning experience has evolved to enable more multidirectional communication using increasingly interactive tools. Learners have greater freedom in choosing how they receive and respond to e-learning content, and any number of peers can be involved.</p>

         <h1>1. PYTHON</h1>
         <h2>What is python?</h2>
        
        <p1>
        What type of language is Python? Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python. Python has a reputation as a beginner-friendly language, replacing Java as the most widely used introductory language because it handles much of the complexity for the user, allowing beginners to focus on fully grasping programming concepts rather than minute details.
        
        Python is used for server-side web development, software development, mathematics, and system scripting, and is popular for Rapid Application Development and as a scripting or glue language to tie existing components because of its high-level, built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding. Program maintenance costs are reduced with Python due to the easily learned syntax and emphasis on readability. Additionally, Python's support of modules and packages facilitates modular programs and reuse of code. Python is an open source community language, so numerous independent programmers are continually building libraries and functionality for it.</p1>
        
            <h3>Here are some things to know about Python:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>What it is: Python is a general-purpose programming language that's used for a variety of tasks, including building websites and software, data analysis, and automating tasks.</li>
 
            <li>What it is: Python is a general-purpose programming language that's used for a variety of tasks, including building websites and software, data analysis, and automating tasks. </li>

             
           <li>How it's used: Python is used by many tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook.</li>
            
             
          <li>How it's written: Python's syntax is similar to English and allows programmers to write code in fewer lines than other languages. Python is also an interpreted language, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it's written. </li> 
             
        <li>What it's used for: Python is used for app development, web development, AI development, machine learning, and data science.</li>
             
        <li>How it's learned: Some basics to learn in Python include Boolean types, strings, mathematical operations, lists and loops, dictionaries, functions, and error checking.</li>
             
          <li> Why it's popular: Python is easy to learn and use, and it's designed to be fun.</li> 
             
           <li>How it got its name: The name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python.</li>

        <h1>2. C++</h1>
        <h2>Introduction to C++ Programming Language</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language.</li>  <li> C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.
                One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software.</li>   <li> At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, making it a popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications.</li>
              <li>  C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for learning and using the language.</li>   <li> Some of the key features of C++ include:
                Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods and properties for these objects.</li>
               <li> Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.</li>
             <li>  Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for working with data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.</li> 
               <li> Exception Handling: C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to write code that can handle errors and unexpected situations.</li>    
        </ul>
